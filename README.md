# AttendXPress

#### Our entry project Mobile App for STI Baliuag's 2nd term 4th quarter i-Learn-Share(iLS).

This Mobile App showcases all the knowledge weve learned throughout the Grade 11 Mobile development. This App mocks the concept of how a Attendance app would work, ranging from how a user could log-in, register, change personal details, check in for attedance, take picture or fingerprint for attendance verification, and administrator account access.
